## Description

This app allows a user to search [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) for articles about a topic, which the user types in a searchbar. The user may then choose a sort option, sorting the news results by date, relevance or popularity. The results are displayed on the app in an appropriate format for the user's device.

### What I improved...

- Added a scroll back to top button in order to go back to the top smoothly on mobile.
- Placed the Search Bar at the bottom of the page on mobile, since it's closer to the user's fingers.
- Implemented app without using class components for the readability and the fast rendering.

### How I might improve the app if I were to complete it

- Add Jest test
- Add No Results Found page when the user cannot get any results
